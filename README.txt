ENCODE AND DECODE MESSAGES USING A ONE TIME PAD ENCODING SCHEME-

encode messages using main method input in Crypt (msg) and scanner input (key) in Crypt class,

decode messages using main input of Decrypt (msg) and scanner input (key) in Decrypt class (utilized Converter class to move back to ascii).

the One Time Pad is interesting in that it is theoretically completely secure and impossible to decode without the key- given that the key is totally randomly generated. Any message can be derived from the cyphertext given all possible combinations of keys are available.
